  <!-- Affiliate Disclosure -->
  <h1>Affiliate Disclosure for All Sites Operated Under Saphah Central Support Services</h1>

  <p>In 2015, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking">Federal Trade Commission</a> released rules for Disclosure Compliance. These ensure readers know if the blogger/presenter is sponsored, endorsed, or partnered. Any/all links may be affiliate links, where I receive a small commission from sales.</p>

  <h2>What are affiliate links?</h2>
  <p>Purchases are made on external affiliate company websites. When a reader clicks an affiliate link, they buy directly from the seller. Commissions support this site at no extra cost to the buyer. Prices are identical whether through affiliate or non-affiliate links.</p>

  <h4>1. Affiliate program links (e.g., Amazon)</h4>
  <p>This site participates in multiple affiliate programs that provide advertising fees. Purchases through these links support our cause. Links are not pay-per-click; commissions are earned only on qualifying purchases.</p>

  <h4>2. Product affiliate links</h4>
  <p>These work the same way: purchases generate a percentage for the site. E-books, e-courses, and online packages often use affiliate links. Prices remain unchanged, and links are not pay-per-click unless specified.</p>

  <h2>What about sponsored content?</h2>
  <p>No posts are sponsored. Paid sponsorships, if any, are clearly disclosed at the beginning of the post.</p>
