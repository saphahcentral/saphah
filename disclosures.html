    <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Affiliate Disclosure for All Sites Operated Under Saphah Central Support Services</u></h1>

    <p>
      In 2015, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission</a>
      released their new rules for Disclosure Compliance. These rules are set in place to ensure that readers or viewers of web media (blogs, YouTube videos, etc.) know if the blogger/presenter is sponsored, endorsed, or partnered with a different company.
      In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please assume the following about links and posts on this site: any/all of the links on this site are affiliate links for which I receive a small compensation from sales of certain items.
    </p>

    <h2><u>What are affiliate links?</u></h2>
    <p>
      Purchases are made on external affiliate company websites: when a reader clicks on an affiliate link located on this site to purchase an item, the reader buys the item from the seller directly (not from this site). Amazon and/or other companies pay this site a small commission or other compensation for promoting their website or products through their affiliate program.
      Prices are exactly the same for you if your purchase is through an affiliate link or a non-affiliate link. You will not pay more by clicking through to the link.
    </p>

    <p>I use two main types of affiliate programs:</p>

    <h4>1. Affiliate links from affiliate programs, like Amazon</h4>
    <p>
      This site participates in several affiliate programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to their properties, including but not limited to their websites. These programs offer a small commission on products sold through affiliate links. Each purchase via our affiliate links supports our cause at no additional cost to you.
      These links are not “pay per click.” If you click on the product link and stay on that site and purchase something else, we may still receive a commission on that sale.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Product affiliate links</h4>
    <p>
      These affiliate links work the same way: if you click the link and buy the product, we receive a percentage of the sale or other type of compensation. Things like e-book bundles, e-courses, and online packages are usually affiliate links as well.
      Again, prices are not different if you use these affiliate links. You will not pay more by clicking through to the link.
    </p>

    <h2><u>What about sponsored content?</u></h2>
    <p>
      I do not write sponsored posts. I want to bring you real, unbiased information. However, if a post is sponsored by a company and it is a paid sponsorship, I will disclose this clearly at the beginning of the post.
