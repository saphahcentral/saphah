      <h2>Welcome — I'm Magdalena</h2>
      <p class="small">This is a quiet place for people who would rather ask hard questions than accept easy slogans. I’m not selling answers - I offer a lamp on the path and a steady hand for the journey. If you want to talk about life, meaning, or the strange things happening in the world - send a message when you join and we’ll talk.</p>

      <h3>Does this sound like you?</h3>
      <p class="small">You notice inconsistencies others ignore - and you want something more than headlines. You prefer careful thought to loud certainty. You value honesty, not just comfort.</p>

    <section class="panel">
      <h3>What might seem wrong for a truth seeker - but isn't</h3>
      <p class="small">Believing everything you read - this is wrong. Truth seekers check and test.</p>
      <p class="small">Thinking everyone who asks is naïve - this is wrong. Honest questions are the best place to start.</p>
      <p class="small">Assuming you must choose between faith and reason - this is wrong. Many find both together.</p>
      <p class="small">Doing nothing because you fear being wrong - this is wrong. Seeking is itself the right move.</p>
      <p class="small">Feeling you must agree with everything we say to stay - this is wrong. You are welcome even while you disagree.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 class="pull">A subtle invitation</h3>
      <p class="small">If you want honest threads, short image posts that make you think, and a private, respectful conversation about your questions - this channel is for you. No pressure. No spectacle. Just clarity and a pathway forward.</p>
